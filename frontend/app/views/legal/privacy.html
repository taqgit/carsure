                        <li>We only collect necessary information about you</li>
                        <li>We do not share personally identifiable information except for obvious reasons</li>
                        <li>We will not spam you</li>

                    <h2>What information do we collect about you?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>User-provided information&mdash;</em> Carsure only collects personally identifiable information that users have voluntarily provided to us. We only ask for information that's necessary for you to access, use and pay for our Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, mailing addresses and credit card numbers. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages and our responses so that we can provide you with better customer service. We also store information that you have indirectly provided to us via your Content and Application(s).

                        <em>Log file information&mdash;</em> Information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.

These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track averaged usersâ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

                    </p>
                    <h2>What do we use your information for?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">We use your personal information only to provide you with the expected features and functionality of the Service and respond to customer service requests. By providing Carsure your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you critical Service notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.

                            We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving these messages by following unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can email us at <a href="mailto:support@Carsure.com">support@Carsure.com</a>.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you (e.g. to process your credit card transactions or provide customer support services). These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this privacy policy.

                                <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
                                    <li>if ObjectLabs Corporation is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets (you would be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information),
                                        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so
