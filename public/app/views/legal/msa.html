                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>1.1.</em> This Master Services Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into by and between ObjectLabs Corporation (henceforth "Carsure"), including its subsidiaries and affiliates involved in providing the Services (together, "Carsure" or "we") and you, the individual or legal entity ("Customer" or "you") that wishes to access and use Carsure's no-cost services or to purchase Carsure Subscription Services (defined below) (together, the "Service"). Your use of and access to the Service is governed by this Agreement, which includes the Carsure Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, and, for purchasers of select High Availability Plans, the Service Level Agreement ("SLA").

                        <em>1.2.</em> This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between Carsure and Customers. By clicking the "I Accept" button (or comparable acknowledgment option), you are indicating that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Customer is an individual, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to enter into this Agreement. If Customer is a legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Customer. If you (i) do not have the authority to bind the Customer; or (ii) do not agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then neither you nor the legal entity you may represent are permitted to purchase, access, or use the Services and you should not click the "I Accept" button (or comparable acknowledgment option). Your permission to access and use the Services is conditioned on your continued and uninterrupted compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. Your Account and Use of the Service</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>2.1.</em> You will be required to provide registration information and create a Carsure.com account (your "Account") in order to access and use the Services. All registration information that you provide must be kept accurate, current, and complete at the time you register and throughout your use of the Service. You agree to promptly update your registration information, if any such information becomes inaccurate or obsolete.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>2.2.</em> You are responsible for the security of your passwords and all other credentials used for accessing your Account or the Service and for any use (authorized or unauthorized) of your Account or the Service under your passwords or credentials. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password, credentials, or Account, you agree to notify Carsure immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>2.3.</em> Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.

                    <h2>3. Subscription Services, Fees, and Payment</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>3.1.</em> Carsure makes certain features, services, and support available for purchase on a monthly basis by Account holders (certain "Subscription Services"). Carsure calculates and bills fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. Fees for partial months of access to Subscription Services will be pro-rated based on the number of days the Subscription Services were made available to you. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Subscription Services using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Subscription Services or new feature of a Subscription Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on <a href="/welcome">https://Carsure.com</a> or any successor or related site designated by us (our "Site") unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services by giving you at least thirty (30) days' advance notice. We may charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <em>3.2.</em> All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we reasonably request to determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you, including your VAT identification number. If you are legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring after the date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

                        <em>5.1.</em> Carsure may make changes to this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion. When these changes are made, Carsure will make a new copy of the agreement available through your Account accessible at the Site.

If you do not accept the revised Agreement, your only recourse is to stop using the Service and terminate this Agreement. If your acceptance of the Agreement by continued access or use of the Service is found to be contrary to law or public policy or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the most recent version of the Agreement that is enforceable and not contrary to law or public policy will be deemed to have remained in effect and to govern your use of the Services.

                        <em>5.3.</em> You may terminate this Agreement at any time by deleting all Your Content, discontinuing your use of the Service and closing your Account. Carsure may, at any time and at its sole discretion, terminate your use of the Service if (A) you have breached any provision of the Agreement (or Carsure reasonably believes that you do not intend to or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Agreement); (B) Carsure is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Service); (C) the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires Carsure to change the way Carsure provides the data or services through the Service; (D) providing the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by Carsure in its reasonable good faith judgment; (E) providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by Carsure in its reasonable good faith judgment; (F) Carsure ceases commercially offering or provisioning all or a portion of the Service; or (G) you are in arrears with respect to any payment due to Carsure under this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement shall also terminate the Terms of Service.

Notwithstanding this, you agree that Carsure shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                        This SLA applies only to those portions of the service provided under Carsure Production Plans that are directly billed by Carsure and have been defined by Carsure as High Availability Plans, where each node is on a Dedicated Virtual Machine with greater than 3GB of RAM. "High Availability Plans" include only Replica Set Clusters and Sharded Clusters where each shard is a Replica Set with the requisite number of data-bearing nodes. The requisite number of data-bearing nodes is two unless the storage used for each node is considered ephemeral, in which case the number of requisite nodes is three. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with this Agreement.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make your MongoDB Deployments (defined below) High Availability Plan available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95%, in each case during any monthly billing cycle (the "Service Commitment"). In the event that we do not meet the Service Commitment, you may be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

                        "Monthly Uptime Percentage" for a monthly billing cycle is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which your MongoDB Deployment was in a state of "Unavailability", excluding any period of "Excused Unavailability".

At our discretion, we may alternatively issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the monthly billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits issued to you may not be transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any Unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the Service is the receipt of a Service Credit (if you are eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.

                            To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@Carsure.com">support@Carsure.com</a>. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us within thirty (30) days of the Unavailability and must include:
                            <ol>
                                <li>the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;
                                    <li>the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;
                                        <li>the name of the applicable High Availability plan and affected cluster id(s); and
                                            <li>sufficient evidence and detailed information outlining the impact, including but not limited to duration of the event, log files, ping metrics, and other availability metrics from third parties.
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                            If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment and you are eligible to receive a Service Credit (as described above), then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is approved by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information within thirty (30) days of the Unavailability as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.
